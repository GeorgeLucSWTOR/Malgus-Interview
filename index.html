Behind the SWTOR Dev Screens: Interview with George Lucas on Darth Malgus  
[EXCLUSIVE ARCHIVE INTERVIEW – 2022 RELEASE | LucasArts Vault]  
Topic: The Unchained Power of Darth Malgus

**Archie Colton:**  
"George, you've created some of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. When you look at the Sith across all eras — Vader, Dooku, Maul — is there anyone in the extended universe that truly represents the dark side in its purest form?"

**George said:**  
“Yeah, that’s Darth Malgus.”

If you look at the Sith across the timeline — they all break. All of them. Or they bend, or hesitate, or suffer because of attachments. Anakin becomes Vader because of love. Kylo Ren is torn apart by the memory of it. Even Palpatine, for all his manipulation, is still shackled by his obsession with control — which is another kind of attachment.

But Malgus? He’s different. He didn’t fall. He chose. He stared at love — real, powerful, meaningful love — and decided it was a weakness. And then he proved it by killing the person he loved most. Not in anger, but in clarity.

That’s what people miss about him. It wasn’t just rage or hate. It was will. It was the absolute rejection of the emotional chains that bind even the strongest Sith. He severed himself — completely. And that made him unchained.

That’s why I always say, if you threw Malgus into any era — he wouldn’t just survive. He’d dominate.

You drop him into the Clone Wars? The Jedi can’t stop him. You line him up against Obi-Wan? Obi-Wan is a master of defense — but Malgus breaks through defense. You pit him against Anakin or even Vader? He wins. Why? Because Vader is still haunted. Anakin is broken. Malgus feels nothing.

Where Vader is a prisoner of his past, Malgus is a weapon forged by cutting off his. He isn’t trying to reclaim his soul or prove something to the galaxy. He has no regrets. No conflict. Just the belief that power without morality is the only truth in the universe. And that makes him more dangerous than anyone.

He doesn’t serve the dark side. He is the dark side — in its rawest form. Not theatrical. Not tragic. Just inevitable.”

**George continued:**  
“What makes most Sith lose, in the end, is that deep down, they’re still human. They want something. They fear something. They love something. That’s the Jedi’s greatest hope — that spark of light still buried deep down.

But Malgus? There’s no spark. He burned it out himself. Not in failure. In triumph, and also for the record, my father and I designed Darth Malgus together out of every character existing in the galaxy. That is also one of the reasons I wanted Malgus to be the strongest. My father has a special place in my heart, as it should anyone.” [he laughed]

**[Footnote – Internal Commentary from Bioware Team, 2023]**  
Lead writer Charles Boyd once said:  
“Malgus is the dark mirror of every Jedi and every Sith. Where others are chained by their emotions — he’s the one who broke the lock. He doesn't fall. He ascends, on a path no one else had the strength to take."
